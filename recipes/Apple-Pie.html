    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Make McDonald's apple pies right at home with this copycat recipe. Better than anything you can get from the drive-thru!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups peeled, chopped (1/2-inch) apples (from 2 small [12 ounces total] mixed variety apples)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice (from 1 medium lemon) </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons granulated sugar, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 (14.1 ounce) package refrigerated pie crust, softened according to package directions (such as Pillsbury)</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Stir together apples and lemon juice. Sprinkle with brown sugar, 2 tablespoons of the granulated sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon of the cinnamon in a medium bowl; set aside until apples release some juice, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high until melted and bubbling. Add apple mixture and reduce heat to medium; cook, stirring occasionally, until apples are softened and juices are just slightly reduced, 6 to 9 minutes. Stir in cornstarch and vanilla; cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is bubbling and thickened, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and let stand until slightly cooled, 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Roll out one refrigerated pie crust into a 12-inch circle.</li>
        <li>Cut into 8 (4x2-inch) rectangles, discarding scraps or reserving for another use. Cover cut dough with plastic wrap and repeat with remaining pie crust. Place 8 dough rectangles on a work surface, and lightly brush with egg all the way to edges.</li>
        <li>Leaving any excess juices in the bowl, spoon about 1 1/2 tablespoons of apple filling in center of each rectangle with a 1/4-inch border on all sides.</li>
        <li>Top with remaining dough rectangles, slightly stretching as needed to align edges with base dough. Crimp edges of rectangles using the tines of a fork and brush tops lightly with egg.</li>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 350Â°F for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, make 3 evenly spaced diagonal cuts on top of each pie to vent.</li>
        <li>Mix together remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and remaining 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a small bowl; sprinkle on top of pies.</li>
        <li>Lightly coat air fryer basket with cooking spray. Add 4 pies to basket, and bake until golden brown and crisp, 14 to 17 minutes. Repeat with remaining pies.</li>
        <li>Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
